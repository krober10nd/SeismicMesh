# Summary

`SeismicMesh` is a Python package for generating quality two and three dimensional triangular and tetrahedral meshes from seismic velocity models using signed distance functions to define geometry. C++ code is wrapped with Python for high performance without losing ease-of-use. Mesh generation is performed in either serial or using distributed memory parallelism through modifications to a mesh generation algorithm known as `DistMesh` [@doi:10.1137/S0036144503429121; @peterka2014high]. The program uses the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library [@cgal:hs-chdt3-20a] to perform many geometric operations efficiently.


# Background

Generating a high-geometric quality graded mesh for a geophysical domain represents a modern challenge for seismological modeling using the Finite Element Method (FEM). In these applications, a domain is discretized typically with triangles/tetrahedral elements that vary widely in size around features of interest. In seismology, these meshes are commonly used with the FEM to solve partial differential equations that model acoustic or elastic waves, which are used in seismic velocity model building algorithms such as Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) [@doi:10.1190/1.1441754; @virieux2009overview] and Reverse Time Migration (RTM) [@10.1093/gji/ggv380].

# Statement of Need

Self-contained automatic meshing workflows that incorporate geophysical data to generate unstructured meshes have been successful in several domains such as coastal ocean modeling [e.g., `OceanMesh2D` @roberts2019oceanmesh2d; `GMT` and `Terreno` @gorman2008systematic] and reservoir modeling [e.g., `MeshIT` @cacace2015meshit]. Besides generating a high-quality mesh, the distribution of elements must accurately represent physical features in the domain such as faults and non-conformities as depicted in geophysical datasets. Element distributions must be placed such that the stability requirements of the numerical solver are satisfied and feature smooth transitions in element size. These aspects motivate the development of a self-contained mesh generation program.

Parallel capabilities are necessary as well as tetrahedral meshes can become computationally expensive to generate. In acoustic and elastic wave propagation, a minimum number between 5 to 10 vertices per wavelength (~250-2000 m) of the source wavelet is applied to ensure the subsequent simulation is numerically accurate. For example, in a 3D mesh of a benchmark FWI model EAGE Salt [@doi:10.1190/1.1437283] this requires 507,862 cells when resolving a 2 Hz source frequency using 5 vertices per wavelength. The number of cells increases by a factor of approximately 8 (approximately 4,082,978 cells) as the source frequency is doubled.


# Core functionality

A schematic of `SeismicMesh` is shown in \autoref{fig:workflow}. The core functionality is as follows:

  1. The creation of 2D/3D graded mesh size functions defined on regular Cartesian grids. These mesh sizing functions contain mesh resolution distributions that conform to the variations from inputted seismic velocity model data and are distributed according to several heuristics [see @SeismicMeshDocs for further details]. Note that mesh size function grading is accomplished using [@persson2006mesh].

  2. Parallelism. The generation of potentially large (> 10 million cells) high-geometric quality triangular or tetrahedral meshes in either serial or using distributed memory parallelism. \autoref{fig:speedup} shows a peak speed-up of approximately 6.60 times using 11 cores when performing 50 meshing iterations to generate an approximately 4 million cell mesh. The usage of 11 cores reduces the generation time of this example from 20 minutes to approximately 2 wall-clock minutes.  The machine used was 2 Intel Xeon Gold 6148 clocked at 2.4 GHz  (40 cores in total, 27 MB cache, 10.4 GT/s) with 192 GB of RAM connected together with a 100 Gb/s InfiniBand network.

  3. An implementation of a 3D degenerate (sliver) tetrahedral element removal technique [@tournois2009perturbing] to bound a mesh quality metric while preserving the domain structure. Note that 2D mesh generation does not suffer from the formation of degenerate elements.

  4. The ability to represent irregular domains implicitly using signed distance functions.

 Similar to other meshing programs such as `gmsh` [@doi:10.1002/nme.2579], `tetgen` [@si2015tetgen] and `mmg` [@mmg], `SeismicMesh` [@SeismicMeshDocs] provides both generation and improvement of meshes through a scripting-based application programming interface.

Domain geometry is defined as the 0-level set of a signed distance function (SDF), which avoids the need to have explicit geometry information defining the boundary. Geometries such as the free surface  boundary, seafloor, volcanoes, and salt-bodies are characterized by pronounced changes to seismic velocities making it possible to demarcate these regions by thresholding seismic velocity. Considering this, a capability is provided in to create signed distance functions from isocontours of seismic velocity using the Fast-Marching method [@sethian1996fast].

# Ongoing and future applications

 Here are some future applications for this software:

 * `SeismicMesh` is being used by a group of researchers to build 2D/3D meshes for a seismological FEM model that has been developed in the Firedrake computing environment [@10.1145/2998441].

 * The usage of SDF to implicitly define the meshing domain presents potential use cases in a topology-optimization framework [@laurain2018level] for modeling the sharp interface of salt-bodies in seismological domains. In these applications, the 0-level set of a SDF is used to demarcate the boundary of the feature. Each inversion iteration, updates to an objective functional produce modifications to the 0-level set. In this framework, `SeismicMesh` can be embedded within the inversion algorithm to generate and adapt meshes.

 * Much like how the original `DistMesh` program has been used, `SeismicMesh` can be adapted for other domain-specific applications besides seismology (e.g., fluid dynamics, astrophysics, and oceanography). An open source project project is already under way to use the same mesh generation technology for a Python version of `OceanMesh2D` to build industrial-grade meshes of coastal oceans [@roberts2019oceanmesh2d].
